                A computer is an electronic device for storing and processing
                data, typically in binary form, according to instructions given
                to it in a variable program. The term "computer" is derived from
                the Latin word "computare" which means to calculate. A computer
                is designed to execute applications and provides a variety of
                solutions through integrated hardware and software components.
                It works with the help of programs and represents the decimal
                numbers through a string of binary digits.

              Computers are all around us from laptop computers to smartphones
              to smart watches they're changing the way that we live our lives
              but have you ever asked yourself what exactly is a computer a
              computer is an electronic device that manipulates information or
              data the computer sees data as ones and zeros but it knows how to
              combine them into much more complex things such as a photo movie
              website game and much more computers use a combination of hardware
              and software hardware is any physical part of the computer which
              includes the internal components and the external parts like the
              monitor and keyboard software is any set of instructions that
              tells the hardware what to do such as a web browser media player
              or word processor when most people say computer they're talking
              about a personal computer this can be a desktop computer or a
              laptop which has basically the same capabilities but in a more
              portable package personal computers come in a few different styles
              the most common type uses the windows operating system max or
              macintosh computers feature the mac os operating system while
              chromebooks run on chrome os smartphones and other mobile devices
              mostly use the ios or android operating systems we'll talk more
              about operating systems in a later video computers come in many
              other shapes and sizes tvs game consoles and even appliances like
              refrigerators can have built-in computers although they may not do
              everything a desktop or laptop can there's another type of
              computer that plays an important role in our lives servers a
              server sends information to other computers on a network in fact
              every time you use the internet web servers deliver the web pages
              that you want to see to your computer servers are also used in
              many offices to store and share files as you can see there are
              many types of computers out there and each one plays a part in our
              modern world gcf global creating opportunities for a better life

                Put simply, programming is giving a set of instructions to a
                computer to execute. If you've ever cooked using a recipe
                before, you can think of yourself as the computer and the
                recipe's author as a programmer. The recipe author provides you
                with a set of instructions which you read and then followWhen we
                give instructions to a computer through code, we are, in our own
                way, communicating with the computer

              Hi, welcome to programming! If you've never learned to program
              before, you might be wondering what programming actually is. Well,
              when we write a program, we're giving the computer a series of
              commands that kind of look like a weird form of English. You can
              think of a computer as a very obedient dog, listening to your
              every command, and doing whatever you tell it to do. So what's so
              cool about programming? Well, it really depends on what you think
              is cool. Because as it turns out, you can use programming for
              almost everything. Programs control robots that can take care of
              patients, and my favorite, robots that can roam around Mars and
              look for water on the surface. Programs help self-driving cars
              know which way to turn-- which is pretty important! Programs help
              doctors cure diseases by processing huge amounts of medical data.
              Programs can be really fun games, like Doodle Jump, Angry Birds,
              Minecraft. Programs make it possible for Pixar to put out their
              awesome 3-D animated movies, and for movies like Harry Potter to
              have such cool special effects. What's your favorite movie? I bet
              that a computer helped make it somehow. Programs are behind the
              websites and the apps that you use every day, all the time, like
              Google Maps, and Wikipedia, and YouTube, and of course, where you
              are now, Khan Academy. Here, on Khan Academy, you'll learn how to
              write JavaScript programs to make drawings, animations, and games.
              And that will be a great start towards creating whatever you're
              imagining in your head. I know, it might be hard to see how a
              drawing program relates to programs for robots, or curing
              diseases. But believe it or not, the same basic concepts are used
              by pretty much every programmer in every program. Once you learn
              to program JavaScript, you'll be able to learn other programming
              languages much more easily. Now you just gotta keep going!

          <h5 class="main__min-header">What are programming languages?</h5>
          <div class="main__container">
            <div class="main__title">
              <p>
                A programming language is a system of notation for writing
                computer programs.[1] Most programming languages are text-based
                formal languages, but they may also be graphical. They are a
                kind of computer language. The description of a programming
                language is usually split into the two components of syntax
                (form) and semantics (meaning), which are usually defined by a
                formal language. Some languages are defined by a specification
                document (for example, the C programming language is specified
                by an ISO Standard) while other languages (such as Perl) have a
                dominant implementation that is treated as a reference. Some
                languages have both, with the basic language defined by a
                standard and extensions taken from the dominant implementation
                being common. Programming language theory is the subfield of
                computer science that studies the design, implementation,
                analysis, characterization, and classification of programming
                languages.

            <p>
              welcome back to another YouTube video. So in this video, I'm going
              to share with you the 10 most popular programming languages and
              what they're used for now, I've taken these rankings from GitHub
              based on the most popular poll request languages in quarter two of
              2020. So ideally this will give us the best idea of the current,
              most popular programming languages. But of course you can argue
              these rankings and I'm sure that the rankings of these languages
              will change as we go through the year. Anyways, with that being
              said, let's go ahead and get started. as no surprise coming in at
              spot. Number one, we have JavaScript. Now JavaScript is an
              extremely popular programming language that is used everywhere on
              the web. Now, although JavaScript can be used as a server side
              programming language with tools like node.js , it is commonly run
              client side within a web browser. Now this enables JavaScript to
              be one of the most versatile languages when it comes to building
              interactive front end user interfaces, any modern website, you
              visit uses a ton of JavaScript to make the website interactive and
              any dialogue form or animation you see is likely being controlled
              by JavaScript. And now with the popularity of front end frameworks
              like boo JS react and angular, it is not surprising the JavaScript
              tops this list. Now as a final thought, it's worth noting that
              JavaScript is dynamically typed, and although it can be used for
              many other applications, there are typically much better choices.
              And at number two, we have my personal favorite programming
              language, which is Python. Now Python is a general purpose
              programming language, meaning it has a much wider use case than
              something like JavaScript that would is heavily used in
              server-side applications, ethical and I guess non ethical hacking
              data science, machine learning, artificial intelligence,
              scientific computing, and general scripting tasks. Now Python is
              known to be easy, to learn, easy to read and easy to write. So
              this makes a great for smaller projects and the tasks that I
              listed above, but its main disadvantage comes from its lack of
              speed. And the fact that it is dynamically typed now just like
              JavaScript. This makes it difficult to maintain in large scale
              projects. So Python has also been used in millions of applications
              around the world. Some of them are Instagram, YouTube, Dropbox. It
              was actually used by NASA in their integrated planning system and
              was even responsible for the AI and the game civilization for so
              Python is usually capable of accomplishing most programming tasks,
              but oftentimes there are far better choices. They may be less
              versatile, but they will be better at that specific task. And we
              will see that as we get through with the rest of this list, moving
              on to Java. So Java is known for being a dying programming
              language, but it's actually still quite widely used and comes into
              our list at number three. Now Java is another general purpose
              language that is well suited for game and mobile app development,
              enterprise level applications, and also web apps. Now Java is a
              statically typed language. It is compiled and although it may be
              frustrating to write in, it provides many advantages in terms of
              structure and code maintainability that you won't get in say
              Python and JavaScript. Now some of those popular applications that
              use Java are of course Minecraft, the Adobe creative suite and
              most general Android applications. Now, as I said, Java is the
              core for Android mobile app development and all the languages like
              Kotlin now exists. It is still used very heavily over 3 billion
              devices, run Java and it follows the WRA principle, which is write
              once run anywhere. So once you've compiled your Java code, it can
              run on any device that runs Java. And to summarize all of this
              Java actually is not that bad of a programming language. And I
              would definitely recommend learning it now go otherwise known as
              Golan is number four on this list and is a fairly new and widely
              used programming language. Goaling emerged as an alternative to C
              plus plus and Java for the app developers at Google and was
              actually created by two Google employees and released in 2012. Now
              robust system level language, right? Typically used on the server
              side for large scale distributed systems goes designed around
              concurrency and is extremely performance. Heavy goes used across
              millions of Google servers and is the backend of some popular
              websites like Dropbox. Now Golang also has Python like syntax and
              as performance similar to C plus plus now this makes it its main
              advantage in how quickly you can develop with it while still
              maintaining high performance. Now I personally am a huge fan of go
              and would encourage anyone, especially any of you that know Python
              to look into it because it's a really interesting language and
              something to add to your tool belt, add to number five, we have C
              plus plus. So C plus plus is the industry standard for AAA games
              and is used extensively to develop 3d applications, operating
              systems, browsers, compilers, and other countless performance
              dependent applications. Now C plus plus is extremely fast and as a
              somewhat unique ability to interface with the user's hardware,
              giving it much more control on a lower level. So imagine like
              talking to a graphics card now C plus plus is known for being a
              difficult language to learn and write in and is not recommended
              for beginners. Generally speaking, you should have a good reason
              to use C plus plus when there are often easier and faster options
              to develop with now, it's worth noting that C plus plus is also
              used on the web, but typically you'll see it more in embedded
              systems and performance concerned applications. Like I've
              mentioned now some examples of C plus plus it's used in the Apple
              iOS it's part of Microsoft windows. It's using database software
              like my SQL and of course almost all your AAA 3d games use C plus
              plus. And moving on to number six, we have TypeScript. Now
              TypeScript is another new ish programming language that was
              actually developed at Microsoft and happens to be a super set of
              JavaScript. So this means almost everything you know about
              JavaScript is transferable to TypeScript with a few minor
              exceptions. Now TypeScript is, as it reads a statically typed
              language that actually transpiles into native JavaScript. So all
              your TypeScript code actually gets transpired or compiled,
              whatever you want to call it into JavaScript before it runs. Now,
              the reason why it exists is actually to make developers lives
              easier by providing interfaces modules, optional, static, typing,
              better code navigation, error detection, and just a ton of other
              things that help with maintainability readability and all those
              things that I've mentioned. Now, TypeScript is used in replacement
              or conjunction with JavaScript to provide a better development
              experience. So while working at Microsoft this summer actually
              wrote a bunch of code for the Python extension in vs code using
              solely TypeScript. So I highly recommend all JavaScript developers
              checkout TypeScript. It won't take you long to learn and it's
              definitely worth it. And number seven brings us to Ruby. Now Ruby
              is a general purpose programming language pretty similar to Python
              is also dynamically typed object oriented. It is a general purpose
              scripting language, and it can be used for many different
              applications, but obviously its most popular implementation is
              rails otherwise known as Ruby on rails, which is used to design
              web applications. Now Ruby is considered to be more elegant than
              Python in terms of web development and is used on popular sites
              like Shopify, get hub, Airbnb, Fiverr, and many more. It is fast
              and to very strict standards and those standards make it easier to
              learn and generally makes the code much more clear when you're
              reading through it. And at number eight, we have everybody's
              favorite programming language, which is PHP. Now PHP is a general
              purpose scripting language that is especially well suited to
              server side web development. So it usually runs on a web server
              and PHP is known as an old dying language and there are many
              alternatives to it now that are typically recommended for new
              development. That being said, many developers still must know and
              be able to write in PHP. And that is because it is used all over
              the web, mostly in older code basis. Now to give you some
              examples, Facebook, Yahoo and Wikipedia were originally developed
              in PHP and WordPress actually uses a ton of PHP today. So there's
              a few specific cases where you may want to use PHP, but personally
              I wouldn't recommend anyone learn it or even use it unless you
              have a very good reason to do so. And at number nine, we have C
              sharp. Now C sharp is extremely versatile and can be used to make
              pretty much anything that said it is particularly well suited for
              building windows based applications and games, and is also
              commonly used to build web applications and recently has become
              more popular in mobile app development. Now I'm sure many of you
              are familiar with the game development engine called unity. Uh,
              this uses C-sharp to design and create games. So like other
              languages on this list, C sharp is maintained by Microsoft is
              continuing to grow year over year. One of the core advantages of
              C-sharp is how massive its library is providing you with higher
              level functionality compared to language to say like Java or C
              plus plus, although this language is not as popular as some of the
              other languages on this list, C sharp is a great language to
              learn, and it is still demanded heavily in the programming
              industry. Now last, but definitely not least. We have C now C is
              by far the most important programming language on this list and is
              responsible for the existence of many of the tools and languages
              we use every single day. Now is the core of almost all operating
              systems, microcontrollers, embedded systems, and a lot of
              enterprise level applications see is extremely flexible and
              versatile and allows control over low-level components and
              hardware that is not found in many higher level programming
              languages, especially a lot of the other ones on this list. Now,
              many experienced developers, highly recommend learning C as it
              teaches you many fundamental programming concepts that will carry
              over to a lot of other programming languages, C excels at memory
              management and fast and efficient execution of code. And all of
              that said, C is extremely difficult to learn. It is not necessary
              for many developers, but it's definitely something that will be
              worth it. If you can get into it and learn about a lot of the
              lower level concepts. Last thing I'll say here, cause I know you
              guys will ask about these languages rust came in at 13 on this
              list. Swift was at 14. Caitlyn was 15, dart was 16 and objective C
              was 17. I will link these resources down below so you can have a
              look, but that has been it for the 10 most popular programming
